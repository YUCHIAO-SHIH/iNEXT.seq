Description: iNEXT.seq provides functions to calculate phylogenetic beta diversity and dissimilarity measures for multiple assemblages, primarily based on genetic sequence data. All computations are based on standardized sample coverage, support hierarchical diversity partitioning, and include corresponding visualization tools for each analysis step. The calculations of phylogenetic beta diversity and dissimilarity measures are available under both relative abundance (Routledge) and absolute abundance (Chiu et al.) frameworks.
